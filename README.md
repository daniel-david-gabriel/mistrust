# Mystrust
Mystrust is a game of suspicion and making the best out of a bad situation. As the player, you will take on the role of an inquisitor of the Church in the land of Varangia. The people's hearts have been corrupted by a vile taint and are beginning to turn on one another. Worse still a few have even embraced the taint and work towards the vile, twisted goals of the one who commands it.

It is your job to oust the tainted individuals while sending the agents back for questioning. Needless to say, the innocent should remain completely unharmed.
